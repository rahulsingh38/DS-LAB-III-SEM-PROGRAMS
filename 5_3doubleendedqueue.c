// Design an algorithm and write a program to implement Deque i.e. double ended queue. Double
//  ended queue is a queue in which insertion and deletion can be done from both ends of the queue.
//  The program should implement following operations:
//  a) insertFront() - insert an element at the front of Deque
//  b)insertEnd() - insert an element at the end of Deque
//  c) deleteFront() - delete an element from the front of Deque
//  d)deleteEnd() - delete an element from the end of Deque
//  e) isEmpty() - checks whether Deque is empty or not
//  f)isFull() - checks whether Deque is full or not
//  g)printFront() - print Deque from front
//  h)printEnd() - print Deque from end
