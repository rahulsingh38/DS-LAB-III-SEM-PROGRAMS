// Design an algorithm and write a program to implement circular queue. Circular queue is a queue
//  in which last position of queue is connected with first position of queue to make a circle. The
//  program should implement following operations:
//  a) Create() - create a queue of specific size
//  b)EnQueue(k) - insert an element k into the queue
//  c) DeQueue() - delete an element from the queue
//  d)IsEmpty() - check if queue is empty or not
//  e) Front() - return front item from queue
//  f) Rear() - return rear item from queue
